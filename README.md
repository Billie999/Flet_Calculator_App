## Calc App
*****
Calc App is a sample calculator implemented using Python 3 and Flet framework which enables us to build UI for the program with Flet [controls](https://flet.dev/docs/controls) which are based on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) by Google. To write a Flet web app we don't need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript, but we do need a basic knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming.
